# The Official Toontown's Funny Farm Issue Tracker
Welcome to the official public issue tracker for Toontown's Funny Farm!

## What is Toontown's Funny Farm?
Toontown's Funny Farm is a single-player spin-off of Disney's Toontown Online. The game's events take place after the famous closure of Toontown, and serve as a "sequel" to the original game. In addition to the Toons relocating to a new town, the Toons are taking new approaches to defeating the evermore powerful Cogs of Cog Nation, Incorporated. New gags, technologies, and strategies for battling the business robots are a key component to gameplay, and these features will keep you immersed in a wondrous and hilarious adventure.

## What is the purpose of this GitHub repo?
Since we're a team of friends who are big fans of the now-defunct MMORPG, Toontown Online, we've taken it upon ourselves to create our own take on Toontown Online, but as a single-player sequel that is completely free-to-play! We are non-profit, meaning we don't make a single bit of money off of our project. We're creating this game in our spare time, around jobs and family life, and out of our own pockets. We want to bring you guys the best experience! Unfortunately, it's not that easy to obtain a suitable self-hostable bug-tracking software for free, so we've decided to turn to the next best thing... GitHub! We will be using this repo to track bugs, crashes, and the like, that are submitted by our players.

## How do I submit an issue report?
